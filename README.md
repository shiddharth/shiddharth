### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Anindya.
I'm a student, an artist and a programmer. I am mainly a web developer who is working on projects based on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS, Python etc. programming languages. My interests are coding and sight-seeing, and I'm looking forward to extend my skills upto machile learning and AI. (Psst! I also like playing Minecraft.)
